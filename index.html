                    <p>My name is Emily Um, I'm 19 years old. I was born and raised in California. I moved to Arizona right after highschool, when I was 17 years old and I currently live with my aunt and her family. I am an only child but I consider my aunt's children my siblings so I am in a way their big sister and baby sitter. </p>

                    <p> I would describe myself as a very energetic, fun loving, curious, creative and caring person. At first people may think that I'm very shy and quiet but actually I'm quite the opposite. I love meeting new people, talking to them and building a strong friendship that will I hope last forever. 
                        I tend to adjust to my environment very quickly and try my best in all the things that come at me.</p>
        
                    <p>Coding to me personaly at first was something only a person with an IQ of Stephen Hawking, so basically almost IMPOSSIBLE.
                        But after I was shown a glimpse of web designing, I fell in love with it. The fact that I can put my ideas in my head onto something that anyone can see and use was amazing.
                        I'm very creative but my knowledge of wed development is what keeps me from displaying my ideas. I'm scared but excited to learn and tackle web development.</p>
